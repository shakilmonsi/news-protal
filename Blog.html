                            What is the difference between bar,let,const </h4>

                        <p>var:
                            In the early days of JavaScript, there was only one way to declare variables and that was
                            using the var keyword.One of the issues is that the variables declared with the var keyword
                            can be re-declared or updated in the same scope.
                            - function scope
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            let:
                            let is the improved version of var. let eliminates all the issues of var that we have talked
                            about in the previous section. let has a similar syntax to var but has a more strict
                            scope.The let keyword should be used in situations where you want to declare a variable that
                            should be restricted to the block in which it is restricted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            const:
                            The const keyword follows the same rules as the let keyword. The only difference with const
                            is that const is used to define only constant values in JavaScript programs.The scoping
                            principles of const are the same as that of the let keyword. Like let, the variables
                            declared with the const keyword will also have scope restricted to the block in which they
                            are declared.

                            What is the difference between arrow function and normal function.</h4>

                            Arrow functions a new feature introduced in ES6 enable writing concise functions in
                            JavaScript. While both regular and arrow functions work in a similar manner, yet there are
                            certain interesting differences between them, as discussed below.

                        <p>
                            .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not
                            change the array and it returns undefined.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the
                            updated elements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns
                            a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.</p>
                        <p>The find() method returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided
                            testing function. If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.</p>

                        <h6>Answer:</h6>
                        <p>
                            Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into
                            strings.Template literals are enclosed by backtick (`) characters instead of double or
                            single quotes.long with having normal strings, template literals can also contain other
                            parts called placeholders, which are embedded expressions delimited by a dollar sign and
                            curly braces: ${expression}.
